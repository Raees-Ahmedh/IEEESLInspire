# Editor Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the Editor Dashboard feature as requested. The Editor Dashboard provides editors with a dedicated interface similar to the Manager Dashboard but with appropriate permissions and functionality for their role.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Role Management
- **Updated User Types**: Added 'editor' role to the user authentication system
- **Role-based Routing**: Editors are automatically redirected to `/editor` after login
- **Permission System**: Editors have specific permissions for their designated tasks

### 2. Editor Dashboard Interface (`/client/src/pages/EditorDashboard.tsx`)
The Editor Dashboard includes three main sections as requested:

#### **Course Section**
- **Functionality**: Same as Admin Dashboard Course Function
- **Features**:
  - View all courses with filtering capabilities
  - Course management interface
  - Add/edit course functionality (similar to admin)
  - Course status management

#### **News Section**
- **Create & Update Articles**: Editors can create and update news articles
- **Approval Workflow**: Articles created by editors require manager approval
- **Database Integration**: Connected to `news_articles` table
- **Features**:
  - Create new articles with rich content
  - Edit existing articles (own articles only)
  - Article status tracking (draft, pending, approved, published)
  - Category management (general, scholarship, intake, announcement)
  - Image URL support

#### **Task Section**
- **Assigned Tasks**: Display relevant tasks assigned by managers
- **Task Management**: Update task status and progress
- **Features**:
  - View assigned tasks with priority and status
  - Update task status (todo → ongoing → complete)
  - Task details with due dates and descriptions
  - Real-time task tracking

### 3. Backend API Implementation

#### **News Management API** (`/server/src/routes/newsRoutes.ts`)
- `GET /api/news/admin/articles` - Get all articles (role-based filtering)
- `POST /api/news/admin/articles` - Create new article
- `PUT /api/news/admin/articles/:id` - Update article
- `DELETE /api/news/admin/articles/:id` - Delete article

#### **Task Management API** (`/server/src/routes/taskRoutes.ts`)
- `GET /api/tasks/my-tasks` - Get tasks assigned to current user
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/status` - Update task status
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task details
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get single task details

### 4. Database Integration
- **Users Table**: Role field supports 'editor' value
- **News Articles Table**: Full CRUD operations with approval workflow
- **Tasks Table**: Task assignment and status tracking

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Support**: Editor role included in token payload
- **Middleware Protection**: All editor routes protected with authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Editors can only access their own articles and assigned tasks

## File Structure

### Client-side Files
```
client/src/
├── pages/EditorDashboard.tsx          # Main editor dashboard component
├── services/apiService.ts             # Enhanced with news and task services
├── store/slices/authSlice.ts          # Updated to support editor role
├── components/Header.tsx              # Updated for editor navigation
├── pages/LoginPage.tsx                # Added editor redirect logic
└── App.tsx                           # Added editor route
```

### Server-side Files
```
server/src/
├── routes/newsRoutes.ts               # News management API endpoints
├── routes/taskRoutes.ts               # Task management API endpoints for editors
├── scripts/createEditorUser.ts       # Script to create test editor user
└── index.ts                          # Updated with new route registrations
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Create Editor User
Run the script to create a test editor user:
```bash
cd server
npx ts-node scripts/createEditorUser.ts
```

### 2. Login Credentials
- **Email**: editor@test.com
- **Password**: editor123

### 3. Access Editor Dashboard
1. Start both client and server
2. Navigate to login page
3. Login with editor credentials
4. Automatically redirected to Editor Dashboard (`/editor`)

### 4. Dashboard Navigation
- **Courses**: Manage university courses (same functionality as admin)
- **News**: Create and manage news articles (requires approval)
- **Tasks**: View and update assigned tasks

## Key Features

### Permission System
- **Editors** can:
  - View and manage courses (same as admin)
  - Create articles (status: pending approval)
  - Edit own articles only
  - View and update assigned tasks
  - Change task status (todo/ongoing/complete)

- **Editors** cannot:
  - Approve articles (manager/admin only)
  - Delete published articles
  - Assign tasks to others
  - Access admin/manager specific functions

### Approval Workflow
1. Editor creates article → Status: "pending"
2. Manager/Admin reviews → Status: "approved"
3. Manager/Admin publishes → Status: "published"

### Task Management
1. Manager assigns task to editor
2. Editor receives task in dashboard
3. Editor updates status: todo → ongoing → complete
4. Manager can track progress

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Redux store updated to handle editor role
- Proper type definitions for all editor-specific data
- Real-time updates for task and article status

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- Proper error handling and validation
- Role-based access control on all endpoints
- JWT authentication on all protected routes

### UI/UX Consistency
- Dashboard design matches Manager Dashboard layout
- Consistent styling with existing components
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states and error handling

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create editor user using provided script
2. Login with editor credentials
3. Verify redirect to editor dashboard
4. Test all three sections (courses, news, tasks)
5. Verify permission restrictions
6. Test article creation and approval workflow
7. Test task status updates

### API Testing
- Use Postman or similar tool to test all endpoints
- Verify authentication requirements
- Test role-based access control
- Validate data integrity

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for task assignments
2. **Article Drafts**: Auto-save functionality for article drafts
3. **Task Comments**: Commenting system for task collaboration
4. **Analytics**: Editor-specific analytics and reporting
5. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk actions for course management

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large data sets
3. **Search**: Advanced search functionality
4. **File Upload**: Support for article images and course materials

## Conclusion

The Editor Dashboard has been successfully implemented with all requested features:
- ✅ Course Management (same as Admin Dashboard)
- ✅ News Article Creation & Management (with approval workflow)
- ✅ Task Management (view and update assigned tasks)
- ✅ Database Integration (news_articles and tasks tables)
- ✅ Role-based Authentication and Authorization
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX with existing Manager Dashboard

The implementation follows best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability while providing a comprehensive solution for editor workflow management.
